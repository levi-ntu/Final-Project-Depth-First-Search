# Final-Project-Depth-First-Search
* Depth First Search, also known as DFS, is a common and useful searching algorithm, which is appied to traversal all the verteices of an entire graph.
* The depth is defined by their number of steps.
  * For example, if there're nodes 1->2->3, then the depth of each node are 0, 1 and 2 respectively.


* Here are the implementing steps:
  * Create a graph with 2D array
  * create a stack, whose first-in-last-out attribute will be used.
  * Implement DFS function
